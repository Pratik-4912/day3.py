The Resume Screening System using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity is a Python-based tool designed to help recruiters identify the most relevant resumes for a given job description. It uses natural language processing techniques to convert resume text and job descriptions into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency). Then, it computes the cosine similarity between the job description and each resume to rank them based on relevance. This allows for faster, more objective, and efficient shortlisting of candidates whose skills and experience closely match the job requirement.
